        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>Born and raised in Saint Louis, Missouri, I embarked on a journey that led me from my hometown to Columbia, Missouri, where I pursued higher education at the University of Missouri. After a year at Mizzou, I found myself seeking a path that truly resonated with my passion. Opting to step away from formal education, I delved into the working world, all the while yearning for that spark of inspiration. It wasn't until a serendipitous encounter during my travels in Europe that I discovered the world of web development. My friend's contagious enthusiasm for her own journey ignited a dormant curiosity within me. However, as life regained its grip, the memory slipped away.</p>

            <p>Months later, the memory resurfaced, and I decided to take the plunge into web development. Beginning with YouTube tutorials, I initially felt daunted by my lack of a Computer Science degree. Yet, witnessing self-taught individuals thrive in the field inspired me to forge ahead. I dived into "freeCodeCamp.org," completing web development and Javascript sections to earn certificates. What began as a challenge swiftly transformed into an infatuation. Hours spent in coffee shops and libraries honing HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills became my norm. Coding awakened a passion unlike any other, infusing my mornings with purpose and excitement. The allure of creativity merged seamlessly with practical problem-solving, setting me on a new path.</p>
            
            <p>As I earned my certifications, I embarked on personal projects, culminating in the creation of this very portfolio. Every step has been a joy, from the humbling beginnings to the triumphs of mastering new concepts. The journey has been nothing short of invigorating, and I stand at the cusp of what's to come, energized and excited for the future.</p>
